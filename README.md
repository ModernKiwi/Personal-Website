# Welcome to the source code of my personal website

This is a personal project that has multiple goals.
I am keeping my code open source incase others find these tools I develop are useful.
Please note this ReadMe is partly pasted from another project so may not be completely correct at the current stage.

## Goals

- Tools to assist with cognitive therapy tasks (Day activity tracker, week planner..)
- ADHD assistant tools (Weekend/trip planners, weather tracking, traffic, reminders)
- Obsidian notes like system for storing knowledge private and public.
- Discord bot intergration?
- Twitch intergration?
- Intergration with Linux Desktop, Custom android OS.
- Make site/app more customisable (eg cms, or wordpress like).

## Background

So I have mental disorders that make life harder than normal, I have found it really hard to find suitable solution without require multiple different softwares and causing struggles to keep it up.
Im trying to make a personal website that will allow me to build an all in one eco system while also providing extra features.
An example would be I can add different weekend/trip activities, if I was to plan a weekend thing and weather did not go well it would provide me with alternatives based on requirements.
I hope to make this system as open as possible and build it into a modular system so others can use what they like, however this is a secondary goal as I am building this as a kind of life assistant to ease the struggles I personally have.

## Feedback/Help

Im going to admit, I aint the best programmer, hell just look at how messy my code is. Due to this I am more than happy for people to provide me with tips, recommendation, or help of any kind.
For example, if you feel I could improve the work by using a particular framework, or changing a module, or so on I am welcome to discuss as I am always hungry to learn more and try different things.

## Can you use this

Sure, I do not see any problems (unless licensing is an issue (I could use help with that as its to much for my simple head)), Please note it is in a very early development so I can not gaurentie how well it will work.
